Having lived in LSE halls, we found it difficult to find an economical and safe place to store our belongings over the holiday period. Most options were either too expensive or simply weren’t student friendly. To save future students from this stress, <B>Pack and Store</B> was born! Our small team aims to provide cheap storage space to students over the Christmas and Easter holidays. We provide highly tailored services, which make the process as easy as it can possibly be.
<br><br>
We currently operate in three LSE halls, Passfield, Roseberry and Carr Saunders.  Our trial period was followed by a highly successful first year, with revenues of over £600. We hope to grow and expand this year, particularly through increased sales volumes. 
<Br><br>
Those who wish to join will be able to put their entrepreneurial and management skills to the test!

Last year we set up a stall selling bubble tea (and other hot drinks as well) on Houghton street weekly, for charity purposes. All profits earned was used to support our social projects.
<br><br>
Total profit for the whole year: £200
Events: <br>Bubble tea Thursday (make a small profit) <br>
Chinese new year events (with fortune cookies)

<Br><br>New members can be expected to monetise their networks by promoting our project's product to them so that we have a strong pool of customers to draw on and raise awareness of Enactus to; members attend one meeting a week and learn about general sales skills.

<h2 class="subheader">Memeory</h2>

	Initially <b>Memeory</b> involved the selling of customised souvenirs on spot in school events. We set up a photo booth, provided our customers with props and helped them take portraits. We then edited the photo with filters, made the photo into a meme and finally framed it in the keychain of our own design. In short, we took portraits on spot and turned them into memetic products for sale during student events. 
<Br><Br>
However, after several business days, we are aware that our customers favour simpler photo designs. We also found that selling pre-made key chains should be easier for the team and our customers. Therefore, later, instead of framing memetic photos with portraits, we came up with a few designs and drawings that were framed and sold.
