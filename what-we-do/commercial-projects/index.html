<h2 class="subheader">Pack 'n' Store</h2>

	<br><br>
Having lived in LSE halls, we found it difficult to find an economical and safe place to store our belongings over the holiday period. Most options were either too expensive or simply weren’t student friendly. To save future students from this stress, <B>Pack and Store</B> was born! Our small team aims to provide cheap storage space to students over the Christmas and Easter holidays. We provide highly tailored services, which make the process as easy as it can possibly be.
<br><br>
We currently operate in three LSE halls, Passfield, Roseberry and Carr Saunders.  Our trial period was followed by a highly successful first year, with revenues of over £600. We hope to grow and expand this year, particularly through increased sales volumes. 
<Br><br>
We are also looking for creative individuals to develop our branding including logo and website design for the project. Students with these interests and skills are also encouraged to join us. Those who wish to join will be able to put their entrepreneurial and management skills to the test!

The F&B project is catered to provide students with some of their favourite drinks (e.g. bubble tea) and snacks to brighten up their day, while still raising funds for our social projects.

<p>
	
The Festive Merchandise project gives members opportunities to display their entrepreneurial skills by allowing them to sell items during certain festivals. Apart from that, members also conduct market researches to find out which items are higher in demand and can allow us to raise more funds.

<h2 class="subheader">Auburn</h2>
<p>

Auburn is an original musical production created by two LSE students and tells the story of a young girl named Rose and how she overcame her stutter problem with singing and a relationship with a guy named Nico. This musical production raised awareness of disabilities suffered by young people as well as the LGBT+ community. Auburn received the prestigious LSE Annual Fund award and attracted over 500 people for its first show.
