<h2 class="subheader">Festive Merchandise</h2>
<p>
	
The Festive Merchandise project gives members opportunities to display their entrepreneurial skills by allowing them to sell items during certain festivals. Apart from that, members also conduct market researches to find out which items are higher in demand and can allow us to raise more funds.

<h2 class="subheader">Auburn</h2>
<p>

Auburn is an original musical production created by two LSE students and tells the story of a young girl named Rose and how she overcame her stutter problem with singing and a relationship with a guy named Nico. This musical production raised awareness of disabilities suffered by young people as well as the LGBT+ community. Auburn received the prestigious LSE Annual Fund award and attracted over 500 people for its first show.
