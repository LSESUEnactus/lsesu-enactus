<p>  
The Consultants Division is a newly formed branch of LSESU Enactus with the aims of addressing the developmental challenges our projects face, as well as providing students with the opportunity to provide customised suggestions and solutions through in-depth research and discussion.
	</p>
<p>
In this Academic Year, the Division will be launching the LSE Enactus Advisory Unit. We seek to identify pivotal challenges and needs that projects seek to address, and as such hope to enhance the engagement of our projects with our beneficiaries. We are also exploring the possibility of linking up with business advisors who will provide guidance and feedback during the course of our work.
	</p>
<p>
We are looking to recruit a team of 8 students this year. If you are interested in working in a team and seek to craft solutions to address the problems in the different stages of a project’s life cycle, this will be a great learning opportunity for you. No prior experience is required.

Do keep a lookout for us during Fresher’s Fair!
