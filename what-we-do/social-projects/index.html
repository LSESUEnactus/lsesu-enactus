	<B>Creative Cycle</b> is a project aimed at helping vulnerable women to secure financial independence. 
We do this through assessing their career goals, whether it be to become an entrepreneur or to get into paid employment.
	Based on this division, we offer them a series of workshops teaching them skills that are relevant to helping them to achieve their aims. 
	The project is very much tailored to their individual needs and so we're very responsive to feedback.

	Examples of workshops include teaching them online selling, marketing, accounting, sessions about performing well at work experience and customer service role plays.
	We are also partnered up with businesses to offer the women work experience.
	<br><br>
	We are interested in first and second year female students with the passion to help others, to become mentors, who are committed to the cause, have good communication skills, patience and empathy, and most importantly a willingness to learn and adapt to their mentees needs. 
	No prior mentoring experience or work with vulnerable women is required, as we will train you! Contact us to find out more.

<B>Uloom</b> is a social project that works with women within an underprivileged community in North East Delhi, India.

<br><br>

The Uloom project aims to create a sustainable income for a group of mothers in an underserved community in Delhi. To date, we have conducted a needs assessment and come up with the business idea for the mothers to start their own clothing enterprise (Couturista), capitalizing on their existing sewing expertise. We also then offered Couturista technical assistance training to kick start the business. We did this through creating a business plan with them, developing their financial model and advising on marketing.
