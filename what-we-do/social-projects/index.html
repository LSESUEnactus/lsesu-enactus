<h2 class="subheader">Creative Cycle</h2>
<p>
	Creative Cycle is a project which promotes up-cycling and provides vulnerable women in London with the technical and entrepreneurial skills to expand their businesses onto the online market.
	<Br>
	In 2014, we held workshops and mentoring sessions to drastically improve the confidence and standard of living of 3 women from <a href="http://www.eavesforwomen.org.uk/">Eaves UK</a> by allowing them to have a more stable source of income.
</p>
<p>
	Continuing from our previous pilot programme, we engaged 3 new partner charities, and tailored our programme structure into an <b>introductory</b> and an <b>intermediate</b> stream.
<Br>
	The <b>introductory stream</b> is targeted at women who are still unsure of their future path, helping them gain clarity on either starting their own businesses or entering the workforce.
<Br>
		
For our <b>intermediate stream</b>, we brought on board women who are already budding entrepreneurs, who were limited to selling on market stalls. 
<Br>
We taught the women how to expand their business outreach by bringing their products online, and developing their financial skill set through accounting exercises and bookkeeping.
