<h2 class="subheader">Creative Cycle</h2>
<p>
	<b>Creative Cycle</b> is a project which promotes up-cycling and provides vulnerable women in London with the technical and entrepreneurial skills to expand their businesses onto the online market.
<br>
<br>
	In 2014, we held workshops and mentoring sessions to drastically improve the confidence and standard of living of 3 women from <a href="http://www.eavesforwomen.org.uk/">Eaves UK</a> by allowing them to have a more stable source of income.
We taught the women how to expand their business outreach by bringing their products online, and developing their financial skill set through accounting exercises and bookkeeping. 
<br>
<br>
Continuing from our previous pilot programme, we engaged 3 new partner charities, and tailored our programme structure into an introductory and an intermediate stream - 
	the former is targeted at women who are still unsure of their future path, helping them gain clarity on either starting their own businesses or entering the workforce, while in the latter, we brought on board women who are already budding entrepreneurs, who were limited to selling on market stalls.

<h2 class="subheader">Gates to Knowledge</h2>
<p> <B>Gates to Knowledge</b> is a social project that aims to provide the women within an underprivileged community in North East Delhi an opportunity to engage in craft-making out of waste denim produced from local factories, in order to increase their financial independence.

<br>
<Br>
Thus far, the women have been producing denim iPhone cases for a month, which will then be sold by the factory in India. 
Looking forward, we hope to better equip these budding artisans with the tools to transition into small and growing business owners by implementing our financial literacy scheme and marketing and selling the cases here in London. 
<Br><br>
We are looking for 1 dedicated, innovative fresher to join us this year.

<p>
	<B>Hope Community</B> is a project designed to help ex-convicts rebuild their lives by setting up their own communal businesses.

<p>
	Inspire is a project aimed at empowering underconfident youths through delivering courses on presentation and interviewing skills.

</p>
