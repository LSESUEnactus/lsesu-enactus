	<B>Creative Cycle</b> is a project aimed at helping vulnerable women to secure financial independence. 
We do this through assessing their career goals, whether it be to become an entrepreneur or to get into paid employment.
	Based on this division, we offer them a series of workshops teaching them skills that are relevant to helping them to achieve their aims. 
	The project is very much tailored to their individual needs and so we're very responsive to feedback.

	Examples of workshops include teaching them online selling, marketing, accounting, sessions about performing well at work experience and customer service role plays.
	We are also partnered up with businesses to offer the women work experience.
	<br><br>
	We are interested in first and second year female students with the passion to help others, to become mentors, who are committed to the cause, have good communication skills, patience and empathy, and most importantly a willingness to learn and adapt to their mentees needs. 
	No prior mentoring experience or work with vulnerable women is required, as we will train you! Contact us to find out more.

<B>Gates to Knowledge</b> is a social project that works with women within an underprivileged community in North East Delhi, India.

<br><br>

We aim to provide these women with an opportunity to engage in craft-making out of waste denim produced from local factories, in order to increase their financial independence.
Thus far, the women have been producing denim iPhone cases for a month, which will then be sold by the factory in India. 
Looking forward, we hope to better equip these budding artisans with the tools to transition into small and growing business owners by implementing our financial literacy scheme and marketing and selling the cases here in London. 
<Br><br>
We are looking for 1 dedicated, innovative fresher to join us this year. 
Contact us to find out more!
