		<h1>About Enactus</h1>
		<p>
			Enactus (formerly SIFE) LSE is part of an international non-profit organisation representing 48,000 students in 39 different countries that works with leaders in business and higher education to mobilize university students to make a difference in their communities while developing the skills to become socially responsible business leaders.
		</p>

		<p>
			Participating students form teams on their university campuses and apply business concepts to develop outreach projects that improve the quality of life and standard of living for people in need.
		</p>

		<p>
			An annual series of regional and national competitions provides a forum for teams to present the results of their projects, and to be evaluated by business leaders serving as judges. National champion teams advance to the prestigious EnactusWorld Cup.
		</p>

		<p>
			In addition to the community aspect of the program, Enactusâ€™ leadership and career initiatives create meaningful opportunities for learning and exchange among the participants as well as the placement of students and alumni with companies in search of emerging talent.
