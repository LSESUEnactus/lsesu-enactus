	If you have an idea that you believe can be turned into reality then why not start your own ENACTUS project? Starting a new project is a rewarding and enriching experience and one that you will never forget. It is a great way to make the most out of your time here at the LSE as well as benefitting society, making new friends and enhancing your personal skill set.
